# Clustering-of-Mall-Customers
This clustering project utilizes the K-Means algorithm to categorize mall customers based on their annual income and spending score. The Elbow Method is employed to determine the optimal number of clusters, and the results are visualized to reveal distinct customer segments for targeted marketing strategies and personalized services.


**Overview:**
This project employs k-means and hierarchical clustering on customer data to identify distinct segments based on annual income and spending score. The elbow method aids in selecting optimal clusters for k-means, while hierarchical clustering is visualized through a dendrogram. The results provide valuable insights into customer behavior for targeted marketing strategies.

**Key Components:**
1. **K-Means Clustering:** Utilizes the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters. Visualizes customer segments based on income and spending score, highlighting centroids.

2. **Hierarchical Clustering:** Constructs a dendrogram to visualize the hierarchical clustering process. Applies agglomerative clustering to categorize customers into distinct segments.

**Tools and Libraries:**
- Python, NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Scipy

**Usage:**
1. Run K-Means clustering to identify distinct customer segments.
2. Visualize results using scatter plots and centroid representation.
3. Explore hierarchical clustering through dendrogram analysis.
4. Analyze and interpret customer segments for targeted marketing strategies.

**Note:**
Ensure required datasets are available for accurate clustering analysis.

**Contributions:**
Contributions and improvements are welcome. Feel free to open issues, provide feedback, or submit pull requests.
