# Clustering-of-Mall-Customers
This clustering project utilizes the K-Means algorithm to categorize mall customers based on their annual income and spending score. The Elbow Method is employed to determine the optimal number of clusters, and the results are visualized to reveal distinct customer segments for targeted marketing strategies and personalized services.


**Overview:**
This GitHub repository showcases a customer segmentation project employing K-Means clustering on a Mall Customers dataset. The analysis aims to categorize customers based on their annual income and spending score, providing valuable insights for targeted marketing strategies.

**Key Components:**
1. **Data Exploration:** Utilizes pandas to read and explore the Mall Customers dataset.
   
2. **K-Means Clustering:** Implements the K-Means algorithm to cluster customers into distinct groups based on income and spending patterns.

3. **Elbow Method Analysis:** Determines the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method, enhancing the accuracy of the clustering model.

4. **Visualization:** Utilizes matplotlib for visual representation, displaying clusters, centroids, and the Elbow Method plot.

**Workflow:**
1. **Data Loading:** Reads and loads the Mall Customers dataset for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Gains insights into the dataset's structure and contents.

3. **Feature Selection:** Selects relevant features (Annual Income and Spending Score) for clustering.

4. **Elbow Method Analysis:** Determines the optimal number of clusters for K-Means.

5. **K-Means Clustering:** Segments customers into distinct groups based on their income and spending habits.

6. **Visualization:** Plots clusters, centroids, and the Elbow Method for clear interpretation.
